##  About Me

<p>
I’m passionate about <strong>continuous learning</strong>, <strong>problem-solving</strong>, and building technology that <strong>connects people</strong> and <strong>creates meaningful impact</strong>.
</p>

<p>
My transition from a <strong>Sales Executive</strong> to <strong>Software Engineering</strong> was driven by deep curiosity about how systems work and a strong desire to challenge myself and grow beyond my comfort zone.
</p>

<p>
I’m inspired by the power of technology to <strong>foster regional integration</strong> — enabling communities across Africa and beyond to collaborate, share opportunities, and innovate together.
</p>

<p>
As I advance my journey as a <strong>Full-Stack Software Developer</strong> — beginning with <strong>Back-End Development</strong> and later expanding into <strong>Front-End</strong> — I’m motivated by a vision to create <strong>scalable, efficient, and inclusive systems</strong> that truly make a difference.
